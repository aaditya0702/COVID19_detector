# coronavirus_detector

Deep Learning model using Keras and Tensorflow to predict whether a person is infected by the Coronavirus. 

This entire project is done based on a tutorial posted by Adrian RoseBrock on his blog.

The aim of the project is to enable automatic detection of Coronavirus based on the X-ray of the lungs, which is more easily available than the current testing methods. 

## How can COVID-19 be detected in X-ray images?
Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of patient's lungs. Since X-ray analysis takes time, developing an automated analysis is required to save time. 

## Source of COVID-19 X-rays
The COVID-19 X-ray image dataset is curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen from the University of Montreal.

## Source of healthy X-rays
We used Kaggle's Chest X-ray images (Pneumonia) dataset to get a set of healthy X-rays.
